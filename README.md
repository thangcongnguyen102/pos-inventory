## üåü Project Overview

This is a **Full-Stack JavaScript** graduation project focused on developing a high-performance **Inventory Management Module** for Point-of-Sale (POS) systems. The module was designed to eliminate the inefficiencies of manual inventory tracking, such as data errors, delayed updates, and the lack of real-time visibility across multiple store locations.

**Key Achievements:**
* **Automated Stock Management:** Real-time inventory updates upon sales and transfers.
* **Multi-Store Support:** Centralized management and seamless item transfers between different locations.
* **Proactive Alerting:** Implemented an automated notification system for low stock levels (via email and dashboard alerts).
